The bracket pad attaches the bracket to the pressure chamber. It is made from a curved section made from carbon fiber. 
Several of these curved sections are made from a larger tube. This tube is made from 850x270mm 200gsm carbon fiber plain weave cloth. This is 3 wraps over a pressure chamber mandrel. Note that the mandrel for this is the actual pressure chamber, rather than the mandrel used to make the pressure chamber. This carbon fiber tube is topped with 1 wrap of 85gsm 300x270mm plain weave fiberglass for a nicer finish. It took 2 pumps to fully wet out.
