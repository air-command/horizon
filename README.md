# Horizon - 2 Stage Water Rocket
## Introduction
The files available in this repository are free of charge, but we would appreciate credit if you use these files in your projects. 
The files are provided as-is in the hope some may be used as a reference when working on your own projects. 

This is not a step-by-step guide how to build the Horizon rocket.
This repository is not an exhaustive breakdown of all the components in the Horizon project, it is simply a collection of files that we had used during the construction of the project.

## Navigating the data set
Components use Unit number / Assembly Number / Part Number labeling scheme.

Example: 03A2A3P6 expands to 03_Booster > A2_Deployment > A3_Camera_Pod > P6_Battery_808
Which refers to the 808 camera battery mount of the camera pod on top of the Booster. 

The **info.txt** files in any folder include general information about that assembly or part. 

## PLEASE NOTE
This repository will be actively updated over the coming weeks/months as we organize all the files.
