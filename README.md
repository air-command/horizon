# Horizon - 2 Stage water rocket
The files available in this repository are free of charge, but we would appreciate credit if you use these files in your projects. 
The files are provided as-is in the hope some may be used as a reference when working on your own projects. This is not a step-by-step guide how to build the Horizon rocket.
This repository is not an exhaustive breakdown of all the components in the Horizon project, it is simply a collection of files that we had used during the construction of the project.
